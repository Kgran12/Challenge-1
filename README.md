## Description

For this challenge I went into the original code that was provided for us, and cleaned it up by adding in semantic HTML so that it made more sense for someone viewing the code

## Solutions/Notes

- I started with updating the title portion of the code to reflect the title of the website
- I updated the header section and the css so that I could remove the header class and reduce the amount of code/get rid of redundences.
- I replaced a div section with nav as that was the navigation portion of the website. from there I had to update the css code so that nav was recognized with the lists and styled correctly
-replaced the dvi with the hero image to figure as that can be used for something that is one or more images.
-updated the di sectioin under the hero image to main, and updated the css style sheet so that anything with main would apply the neccessary styles. I did this to reduce the amount of code and get rid of the un needed class
-all the div sections under main were updated to sections.
-I  updated the next div to be an aside as it was a side bar portion of the website. From there I was able to update the css so that anything labled aside would apply the right styles. Again I did this to reduce the code and get rid of any uncessary classes.
- I updated all the divs under the aside to sections.
- I updated the div at the bottom to be a footer as it was the footer of the website. I also updated the css style sheet to just apply the right styles to anything called footer. This was to get rid of uneccessary classes and reduce the amount of code.
